# 🤝 Contributing

To add a new repository to the solutions list add a new entry like this for GitHub-hosted repos (sorted alphabetically, please 🙏):

    - [username/repository](https://github.com/username/repository) ![Last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/username/repository?style=flat-square)

or like this for non-GH repos:

    - [username/repository](https://somewhere-else.com/username/repository)

Repositories not hosted on GitHub are fine, but they won't have a "last commit" badge.
